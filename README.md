# 📌 SoftmaxRegression
A lightweight implementation of Softmax Regression (also known as Multinomial Logistic Regression) for multiclass classification problems. This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of supervised learning using gradient descent and cross-entropy loss to train a linear classifier on labeled data.

# 🔍 Key Features
* Implements Softmax activation for multi-class classification
* Uses cross-entropy loss for optimization
* Gradient descent for training
* Supports feature normalization
* Visualizations of training performance (loss and accuracy)
* Well-commented and beginner-friendly code

# 🧠 Concepts Covered
* Linear models for classification
* One-hot encoding of labels
* Softmax function
* Cost function and backpropagation
* Batch gradient descent

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (for visualizations)
* Jupyter Notebook or plain .py scripts

# 🚀 Potential Extensions
* Add mini-batch or stochastic gradient descent
* Add L2 regularization
* Build an interactive demo using Streamlit or Gradio
* Train on real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST, Iris)
