# SoftmaxRegression
A lightweight implementation of Softmax Regression (also known as Multinomial Logistic Regression) for multiclass classification problems. This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of supervised learning using gradient descent and cross-entropy loss to train a linear classifier on labeled data.
